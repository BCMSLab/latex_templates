A collection of latex templates.

## Latex & Overleaf

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/about) is a free service that lets you create, edit and share your scientific ideas easily online using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org), a comprehensive and powerful tool for scientific writing.

## Using the templates
